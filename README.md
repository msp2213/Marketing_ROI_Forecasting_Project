# Capstone Project: CPG Marketing ROI & Financial Analytics

## Project Overview
This project provides an end-to-end data pipeline and analytical suite designed for a private equity group to optimize marketing ROI and profitability across its portfolio of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) brands. The system transforms fragmented, unstructured Profit and Loss (P&L) data into actionable insights through automated ETL, interactive dashboards, and predictive modeling.

## Core Deliverables
The project is structured into four primary workstreams:

Deliverable 1: AI-Powered ETL Pipeline
  - Automates the ingestion of inconsistent Excel P&L statements.
  - Uses Python and AI-based transformation to normalize account names and produce a standardized vertical dataset.
    
Deliverable 2: Interactive Financial Dashboard (My Primary Focus)
  - Built in Tableau to provide a unified view of revenue, margins, and trade spend effectiveness.
  - Consolidates fragmented data into interactive visualizations to monitor ROI indicators and cost drivers across multiple brands.
    
Deliverable 3: Forecast & Simulation Model
  - A regression-based tool to identify statistically significant marketing and trade spend levers.
  - Features a 2025 Net Profit simulation based on historical spending trends.
    
Deliverable 4: NLP Sentiment Analysis
  - Leverages customer reviews to assess real-time sentiment using Bing, NRC, and AFINN lexicons.
  - Identifies recurring themes to guide product refinement.

## Tableau Dashboard Highlights
